Millions of people worldwide are affected by the common and serious health issue known as chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is characterized by a progressive decline in kidney function, which can have a variety of negative effects and can be fatal. Effective illness management, which can greatly improve patient outcomes and lessen the strain on healthcare systems, depends on early and precise diagnosis.
Machine learning algorithms have become effective research tools in recent years, particularly for the diagnosis and prediction of diseases. Among these, classification algorithms have drawn a lot of interest because of their capacity to divide data into various classes based on particular characteristics. However, in order to guarantee these algorithms efficacy and dependability when used to diagnose CKD, a thorough and in-depth analysis is required.
This paper gives a comparative examination of four well-known classification algorithms for the early identification of CKD: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. We broaden our analysis to look at how sampling strategies and imputation procedures affect categorization accuracy.
We use a broad and carefully curated dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning (ML) Repository to enable a thorough evaluation. This dataset contains important data that is necessary for a precise diagnosis of CKD, such as medical history and laboratory test results.
We reveal the varied accuracy levels attained by KNN (56%), Naive Bayes (96%), Decision Tree (99%), and Logistic Regression (88%) by performing each classification technique separately. We address the intrinsic class imbalance frequently seen in CKD datasets by using various sampling techniques— undersampling, oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)—for each algorithm. Additionally, the use of imputation methods (mean, mode, and median) to handle missing data allows for an evaluation of their influence on classification accuracy.
Medical professionals and researchers can choose the best categorization strategies for diagnosing CKD with the help of the insights gathered from this thorough analysis. We want to increase our understanding of classification models for CKD diagnosis by taking into account dataset characteristics, class distribution, and missing data. This will help with the early detection and better management of this debilitating condition.
